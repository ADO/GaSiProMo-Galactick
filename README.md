#1. Galactick and 2. Splitzilla

##Galactick

I made a SPA years ago for Galactick as an experiment with jQuery touch and Bootstrap. I'd like to expand upon that concept and learn Meteor... there's already a starter to-do app in Meteor and even a tutorial using Meteor and React.

Features I'd like:

* Facebook / Twitter / other OAuth
* instant updating items between different browser windows
* cut / copy / paste items between days
* print template for the day to tick-off on paper

##Splitzilla

For [Rails Rumble](http://www.railsrumble.org/) this November the current plan is that I'm teaming up with James Stackhouse to develop a social accounting / payment app: Splitzilla. Log individual bills and track who owes what to whom. It's a 48 hour programming competition and my plans for this app go well into months of solid coding so I'm currently struggling to set a feature list for a MVP achievable for the comp.
